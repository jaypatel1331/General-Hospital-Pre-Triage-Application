# General-Hospital-Pre-Triage-Application

Because of the pandemic and prevention of the spread of COVID19, hospitals need to screen the patients and separate those in need of COVID-test from others. This has to be done in an orderly fashion by letting the patients know what is the expected wait time and let them know when they can be admitted to prevent lineups. 

## The Pre-Triage Application
The application starts by displaying a simple menu with three options:
```Text
General Hospital Pre-Triage Application
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>
```
### Register
The register option is selected to screen patients before getting into the hospital. The user can select between a COVID Test or Triage.

COVID test is selected if the patient is at the hospital for a COVID Test. In this case, the patient's name and OHIP number are entered and then a ticket will be printed with a call number and estimated time of admission for the patient.

If Triage is selected then in addition to the patient's name and OHIP number, the symptoms of the patient are entered. Then a ticket for Triage is printed with an estimated time of admission.

### Admit
Admit is selected when the COVID Test area or the Triage section is ready to accept a patient. After selecting COVID or Triage, the patient with the next ticket in line will be called. Based on the time of the call, the average wait time for the next patient for that lineup (COVID or Triage) will be updated.
